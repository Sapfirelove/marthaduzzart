                   <p>At the age of six was when I gained an understanding that with a pencil you could create something. I also found out your parents donâ€™t like it when you draw on their walls with markers. </p>
                   <p>From there I was drawing every day. You know when the hands look like balloons and way too large for their body. As I got older I started watching a YouTube Creator by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/markcrilley"> Mark Crilley </a> where I learned basic skills.</p>
                   <p>I was taking every art class my high school provided until I graduated. At the age of 17 was when I was getting serious about my art. I wanted to draw more while showing everyone I knew my work. I created all my social media, set up my shop, and was ready to go.</p>
                   <p>My next adventure starts now!</p>
